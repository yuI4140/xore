# Math++
*a.hpp which will have everything that can be done with math.h, but improved and with modern C++*.
### Usage
*download it from **github.com/** or do a git clone 

```bat
  git clone --recursive "URL" foldername #or not 
```
*and include in your project.*
### Purpose of the Project
**learn more c++ and math also have a math header that doesn't load dependencies only from iostream and some core but nothing from <any,stdlib,algorithm,math.h> at first I may use math.h to test some things but I will remove it.**
### Future Implementations
#### functions inside stdlib.h
**Functionality**:*computes absolute value of an integral value (|x|)*


    -abs
    -labs
    -llabs


##### Defined in Header <math.h>
- **Basic operations** 
- **Exponential functions**
- **Power functions**  
- **Trigonometric functions**
- **Hyperbolic functions** 
- **Error and gamma functions**
- **Nearest integer floating-point operations**
